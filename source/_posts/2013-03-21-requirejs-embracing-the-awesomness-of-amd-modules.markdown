Over the past few weeks I put together this talk for my team at GE to help get everyone on the same page with AMD modules. I figured it'd be cool if I removed any GE specific stuff and open sourced the presentation, so here it is!

The video is around 35 minutes long and there's a slide deck available on Github that has clickable links and whatnot. Enjoy!
