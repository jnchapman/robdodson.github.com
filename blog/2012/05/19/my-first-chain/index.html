		<p>Back in April I was reading hacker news when I came across a blog posted titled <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2012/04/366-or-how-i-tricked-myself-into-being.html">&#8216;366 or How I Tricked Myself into Being Awesome&#8217;</a>. It was written by a fellow named Chris Strom. It was written on blogspot. It was mostly unstyled.</p>

<p>Chris wrote every single day for 366 days and in so doing self-published three books on programming languages that he knew nothing about. His post was to champion that milestone. At the time I read it and thought, &#8220;I can totally do this,&#8221; meaning if I follow the steps that Chris has outlined I can potentially trick myself into becoming a blogger.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>That probably seems rather silly to say but it&#8217;s true. Every developer I know Googles for answers when they&#8217;re stuck or trying to learn something new. <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">And it seems like</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/">over and</a> <a href="http://www.leebrimelow.com/">over again</a>, <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/">we end up</a> <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/">in the same places.</a> And if you&#8217;re a developer, or maybe if you&#8217;re just me, you totally revere these people. They are guides in what is a truly unfamiliar world and they do it without asking anything in return.</p>

<p>So I set out to try to do my own chain. I have to write until I go to Europe on June 27th. At this moment I have 22 blog posts that I&#8217;ve written as a result of the chain. Prior to that I&#8217;d written 3 in an entire year. At first I found the whole process exhilarating, until it started to get in the way of my personal activities. Now I have to figure out how to write something of substance while still balancing my job and my home life. This is not easy. It requires setting boundaries and self-discipline. I try to write in the mornings, usually between the hours of 7 to 9. Frequently I don&#8217;t finish and my posts have to be resumed in the evening. But working like this interferes with the time I can spend with my girlfriend and that breaks one of the unspoken rules I have which is that writing should not disturb my normal social life. Getting to the first 10 posts this was not a problem but now that I&#8217;m passing 20 it is. I&#8217;ve changed my writing style from full blown tutorials to more of a play-by-play as I code. I&#8217;m always striving to be more succinct in what I write but usually the challenge is disappearing down a rabbit hole while I research something new only to realize that I&#8217;ve blown half an hour of my writing time googling minutia. I&#8217;m going to try to associate googling minutia with some guy getting in between me and my girlfriend. As a result I will want to stab googling minutia.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you find this post and you are thinking about writing let me tell you that I <strong>highly</strong> recommend it. Here is some quick advice:</p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t worry about what your blog looks like.</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m 100% serious on this point. If you spend any time designing your blog before you write your first 5 articles then you&#8217;re doing it wrong. I have fallen into this trap innumerable times. Just accept this challenge: Make it to 10 blog posts, then you can redesign the thing.</p>

<p>I think we fall in love with the idea of having a beautiful blog and get lost in design and programming how everything will look. This is a mistake. Blogging is supposed to just be a journal of what you&#8217;re currently working on and thinking. Assume no one will read it (this is probably true). After you have a few readers then work on the look and feel if you choose. Personally I&#8217;ve found that not worrying about the design at all has been incredibly freeing. Again, look at <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2012/04/366-or-how-i-tricked-myself-into-being.html">Chris Strom&#8217;s blog</a>. He has a ton of readers, is a published author, and is running the default blogspot theme.</p>

<h3>Try to write at the same time every day</h3>

<p>I find it easiest to focus in the morning especially when everyone else is asleep. I think Chris works late at night. Figure out what times suits you and do your best to stick to it. When I finish a post in the morning I feel free for the whole rest of the day. It&#8217;s kind of cool to have that sense of accomplishment before arriving at work :D</p>

<h3>Use the best tools you can</h3>

<p>I tried writing in Wordpress on several different occasions. I&#8217;ve also tried Tumblr and Posterous. I find writing in shitty WYSIWYG editors drives me totally crazy. There are apps out there that let you write in more of a desktop setting but I&#8217;m not sure if they are still subject to Wordpress or Tumblr&#8217;s weird formatting. Basically if you&#8217;re writing a code blog it fucking sucks to use a WYSIWYG because they&#8217;ll try to wrap all of your funky syntax in weird markup. I found <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and it&#8217;s been the best tool I&#8217;ve ever used for writing. I also <a href="http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/04/30/custom-domain-with-octopress-and-github-pages/">wrote a little article</a> on it if you&#8217;re trying to get it setup for your personal domain. Octopress is great because it uses <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, the same language that&#8217;s used to generate most of the pages on Github, there&#8217;s no database and you can write in any text editor. I do all of my blogging in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>, often times with my blog in one cell with my code in the other. Here&#8217;s a screenshot of what this can look like.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/side_by_side_blogging.png" title="'Awesome splits!'" ></p>

<h3>Don&#8217;t worry when no one reads it</h3>

<p>Finally, don&#8217;t get too hung up on who is (or isn&#8217;t) reading your blog. I know that pretty much all of the visits I see in my google analytics are actually just me checking the site on my phone or laptop. Definitely <em>do</em> add analytics so you can see which parts are successful and which are not but don&#8217;t expect to be <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> overnight. In fact, don&#8217;t ever expect to be Daring Fireball. Keep in mind that what you&#8217;re doing is a personal journal. It may not seem like blogs are framed in that context but that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re best at. I often times find this really interesting flow where I write down what I think I should build before I build it, then I write a test, then I write the implementation. Often times I work out what I&#8217;m doing in the blog post well before I&#8217;ve even written the test. This is like a whole other kind of BDD, Blog Driven Development :) Use it for what it&#8217;s best at and you&#8217;ll find it rewarding.</p>

<p>Ok that&#8217;s it for now. Goodnight!</p>
