		<p>I&#8217;ve been using Sublime Text 2 for probably two months now and in that time I&#8217;ve discovered tons of useful tricks. I figured I should start writing them down for anyone who might be interested. I&#8217;ll try to explain the bits that seem esoteric because there are a lot of cool commands which only work in certain contexts.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Finding your preferences</h2>

<p>One of the first things you want to do with Sublime is to find your User key bindings. They&#8217;re located under <code>Sublime Text 2 &gt; Preferences &gt; Key Bindings - User</code></p>

<p>Sublime Text is very DIY so there isn&#8217;t a fancy GUI to help you change keyboard shortcuts. Instead you use the preference file to override the default shortcuts. Like a lot of things in Sublime, this can at first seem annoying and non-intuitive. That is, until you realize that by doing it this way Sublime has actually given you the power to make <em>extremely</em> awesome key bindings. Take some time to look around in this file. I still only understand a fraction of what all it does but the little bits I learn here and there give me all sorts of ideas for new shortcuts. Just remember, if you want to change a keyboard shortcut you should do it in the User&#8217;s key bindings and not the Default key bindings.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you ever want to change a keyboard shortcut but can&#8217;t figure out what command is currently running open up Sublime&#8217;s built in terminal with <code>ctrl+`</code> then type <code>sublime.log_commands(True)</code>. Now when you execute your command from the menu you should see its name show up in the console. Just remember to turn logging off when you&#8217;re done :)</p>

<h2>Sublime Package Control</h2>

<p>If you only follow one piece of my advice make it this: <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control">Install Sublime Package Control.</a></p>

<p>Package Control makes it extremely easy to manage your Sublime plugins. It also helps with discovering new ones, which is nice. Just install it if you haven&#8217;t already, it&#8217;s impossible to live without.</p>

<h2>Setting up a command line shortcut</h2>

<p>I highly recommend setting up a symlink so you can easily open things with Sublime. <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/osx_command_line.html">This article details how to go about it on OSX.</a></p>

<p>CLI FTW!</p>

<h2>The Command Palette</h2>

<p>OK, so hopefully you&#8217;ve setup Sublime Package Control. Maybe you&#8217;ve even installed some plugins. It&#8217;s time for you to meet the Command Palette then. <code>cmd+shift+p</code> will open up the window and from here you can execute just about any command either native to Sublime or part of a plugin. It is super useful for all those things you don&#8217;t run often enough to turn into full blown keyboard shortcuts. It&#8217;s also useful if you know the name of a command but can&#8217;t remember what section of the menu it lives under.</p>

<h2>Goto Anything&#8230;</h2>

<p>So you want to fly around your project like a ninja on methamphetamines, eh? Then the shortcut you want is <code>cmd+p</code>. Once you&#8217;ve opened the dialog try typing a filename. Useful right? But wait, there&#8217;s more&#8230;</p>

<p>If you preface what you&#8217;re typing with a <code>@</code> it will look for &#8220;symbols&#8221; in the current file. Ex: <code>@foobar</code>. But just typing <code>@</code> will give you a nice file outline. The definition of what a symbol is depends on the file-type. In a Markdown file, for instance, it will list every header. In a JavaScript or Ruby file it will list every method of an object.</p>

<p>One last trick. If instead of an <code>@</code> you preface things with an <code>:</code> you can type a line number instead and hit enter to jump to that point. Ex: <code>:415</code></p>

<p>There are other keyboard shortcuts for jumping to a line and going to a symbol but why bother when you can just use <code>cmd+p</code> and some easy prefixing.</p>

<h2>Splitting the editor windows</h2>

<p>OK this one is also important and I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. <strong>Learn to split your editor windows.</strong> I never used this feature in previous IDEs and now I wonder how I ever lived without it. Whether you have a unit test in one window and an implementation in the other, or some HTML and CSS, this feature is just always handy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/robdodson/images/sublime-split-panes.png" title="'Split windows in Sublime'" ></p>

<p>I <em>live</em> in split panes. They&#8217;ve changed my workflow significantly for the better. Less time switching between files and finding your place is an incredible advantage. You can access them through <code>View &gt; Layouts</code>. It will behoove you to learn these keyboard shortcuts. Also learn the shortcuts for <code>View &gt; Focus Group</code> and <code>View &gt; Move File to Group</code>.</p>

<h2>Selections</h2>

<p>There are some neat selections which come in handy depending on your context. Personally I use Expand Selection to Tag, <code>cmd+shift+a</code> quite frequently when writing HTML. I also use Expand Selection to Line, <code>cmd+L</code> and Expand Selection to Word, <code>cmd+D</code> a lot.</p>

<h2>Selections with Multiple Cursors</h2>

<p>Multiple cursors&#8230; It&#8217;s one of those things you didn&#8217;t realize you needed until suddenly you had it and you were all like &#8220;WHAAAAAAAAT!&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a handful of ways to activate multiple cursors in Sublime. Hitting <code>cmd+D</code> to select multiples of the same word will put us into a multi-cursor context.</p>

<p>Another way to go about it is to highlight a block of text and hit <code>cmd+shift+L</code> which will split each line into its own selection. This is extremely useful when editing HTML where often times you have repeating elements and you want to tweak a class name on all of them.</p>

<p>You can also just hold <code>cmd</code> and click around your file to add more cursors. Or you can hold <code>ctrl+shift</code> and tap either the up or down arrows to add a new cursor in that direction.</p>

<h2>Moving Lines</h2>

<p><code>Edit &gt; Line &gt; Swap Line Up</code></p>

<p><code>Edit &gt; Line &gt; Swap Line Down</code></p>

<p><code>Edit &gt; Line &gt; Duplicate Line</code></p>

<p>Learn em. Love em. I changed my keyboard shortcut for these so I can&#8217;t recall what it is by default. Regardless I think I use these three commands more than any other so I would say if you only learn three shortcuts, make it these three.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to duplicate a block of code highlight it and hit <code>cmd+L</code> to select the new line before you hit <code>cmd+shift+D</code>. This way your duplicated block will appear on a new line, rather than next to the previous block of code.</p>

<h2>Wrap your lines</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;ve installed the <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/Tag">Tag plugin</a> you should have some extra line wrapping methods. I would also recommend you install <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sublimator/sublime-2-zencoding">ZenCoding</a>. I&#8217;m suggesting this for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>You get awesome new features&#8230;</li>
<li>I can&#8217;t remember if what I&#8217;m about to say is native to Sublime or part of a plugin.</li>
</ol>


<p>OK with that out of the way&#8230;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re working on some HTML and you have a block of text that you&#8217;d like to wrap in a <code>p</code> tag. No problemo! Highlight the text and hit <code>ctrl+shift+w</code> or <code>Edit &gt; Tag &gt; Wrap Selection in Tag</code>. There&#8217;s a more advanced versions that comes with the ZenCoding plugin which lets you do really elaborate wrappings. I believe the keyboard shortcut for that is <code>ctrl+alt+w</code>. Personally I dislike using the <code>ctrl</code> key on my Mac laptop so I changed both of those keyboard shortcuts to the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><pre><code>{ "keys": ["super+shift+r"], "command": "insert_snippet", "args": { "name": "Packages/XML/long-tag.sublime-snippet" } },
{ "keys": ["alt+shift+r"], "command": "wrap_zen_as_you_type",
"context": [
    {
      "operand": "text.html, text.xml",
      "operator": "equal",
      "match_all": true,
      "key": "selector"
    }
  ]
}</code></pre></figure>


<p>You&#8217;ll notice that instead of just using a <code>wrap_in_tag</code> command name the first entry actually calls another command, <code>insert_snippet</code> and passes it an argument: <code>Packages/XML/long-tag.sublime.snippet</code> which is the location of a snippet file. Pretty cool trick!</p>

<p>Also note that Sublime uses the term &#8220;super&#8221; to refer to the command key</p>

<h2>Bookmarks!</h2>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me then you lose your place in large files. That&#8217;s where bookmarks can be a big help. <code>cmd+F2</code> will add a new bookmark on the page. The bookmark is tied to the line so if you use the move line up/down commands it will move the bookmark as well (nice). To cycle through your bookmarks just hit F2. The rest of the bookmark commands are located in <code>Goto &gt; Bookmarks</code>. Take note of the one that says <code>Select All Bookmarks</code> which will basically let you do a multi-selection on all of the lines you&#8217;ve already bookmarked.</p>

<h2>Marks</h2>

<p>Marks are very similar to bookmarks but they serve a different purpose. They&#8217;re located in <code>Edit &gt; Mark</code> and their keyboard shortcuts are a little weird because you need to hit <code>cmd+K</code> and then a secondary shortcut like <code>cmd+space</code>. I find myself using Marks a few times a day to do large selections. For instance if you have a big block of HTML it can be very tricky to stay inside the proper scope if you&#8217;re trying to delete all the contents of a very high level container. With Marks you can just put a mark on the opening line of the container, hit <code>cmd+shift+a</code> to select down to the bottom of the tag, and then hit <code>cmd+K, cmd+a</code> to select everything back to your previous mark. Marks can also be used to swap lines of text but I&#8217;ve never needed to do that in practice.</p>

<h2>Hide the Sidebar</h2>

<p>To hide the sidebar hit <code>cmd+K, cmd+B</code>. Since I work on a laptop I often hide the sidebar to give myself that extra 100px of reading space.</p>

<h2>Turn off Minimap</h2>

<p>Do you guys use that minimap thing in the top corner of the editor windows? I find it <em>incredibly</em> distracting and it also takes up screen space. To disable it go to <code>View &gt; Hide Minimap</code>.</p>

<h2>Saving a project</h2>

<p>This one might be obvious for many of you but it wasn&#8217;t something I was really taking advantage of until recently. Once you have a folder open it can be beneficial to save it as a project via the <code>Project &gt; Save Project As...</code> command. Save the project files in the root of your app and then whenever you do <code>Project &gt; Recent Projects...</code> it will open everything up with all your windows just as you left them.</p>

<p>To switch between projects use <code>ctrl+cmd+p</code>.</p>

<h2>Some awesome plugins</h2>

<p>Sublime is all about plugins so here&#8217;s a list of some of my favorites. Once you have Package Control installed you can just hit <code>cmd+shift+p</code> and type <code>discover</code>, then hit enter which will take you to a page listing tons of plugins. Try out some (or all) of the ones below. They&#8217;re great :D</p>

<ul>
<li>AdvancedNewFile</li>
<li>HtmlTidy</li>
<li>Nettuts+ Fetch</li>
<li>Prefixr</li>
<li>RubyTest</li>
<li>Shell Turtlestein</li>
<li>SideBarEnhancements</li>
<li>sublime-github</li>
<li>Sublime-JSHint</li>
<li>SublimeCodeIntel</li>
<li>Tag</li>
<li>ZenCoding</li>
</ul>


<h2>Convert Case</h2>

<p>If you highlight some text you can use <code>cmd+K, cmd+U</code> to uppercase it. Likewise you can use <code>cmd+K, cmd+L</code> to lowercase it.</p>

<h2>Spell Check :)</h2>

<p>Finally I wouldn&#8217;t be much of a blogger if I didn&#8217;t point out the spell check feature. Hit <code>F6</code> to check your current file. Once you&#8217;ve turned it on the spell checker will stay on until you hit <code>F6</code> again.</p>

<h2>Hack the Planet!</h2>

<p>We&#8217;ve only really scratched the surface of what Sublime is capable of. In the future I&#8217;d like to write more about its awesome Macros, Snippets and Plugin architecture. Till then, have fun hacking. - Rob</p>
