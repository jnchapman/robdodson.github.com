		<p>On April 28th, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=964312982287&amp;set=a.616835240467.2181266.39601696&amp;type=1">I vowed to write a blog post a day until I had to go to Europe.</a> Of course the real threat was that if I failed to do so I would have to give 500 dollars to the Republican party, most likely to John Boehner. In my original post I said I would write till the 27th but I&#8217;ve moved that date up so I can spend tomorrow night packing and wrapping things up in the city before I head out on my trip. So tonight&#8217;s post will mark the end of my first chain which means it&#8217;s time for a little post-mortem.</p>

<h2>Why Did I Do It?</h2>

<p>Everything started because of a <a href="http://japhr.blogspot.com/2012/04/366-or-how-i-tricked-myself-into-being.html">blog post written by a fellow named Chris Strom.</a> Chris wrote every single day, for a year, and in that time he managed to self publish 3 books. I think many people would be happy to publish a book in like a couple years. At Chris&#8217; rate he was cranking one out nearly every 3-4 months. Amazing.</p>

<p>I started thinking&#8230; this whole writing thing has got to be like exercise. If you just will yourself to do it, it&#8217;ll be hard at first but after a while <em>surely</em> it becomes a habit. And who doesn&#8217;t want to be in the habit of exercising more?</p>

<p>Writing, self-reflection, discovery&#8230; these are <em>really</em> important. I get by in my career by reading the stuff that other people have been generous enough to put down on the page (or blog, as the case may be). If I have a problem I just type it into the little magical Google box and out pops an answer.</p>

<h1>That&#8217;s fucking incredible!</h1>

<p>But that system doesn&#8217;t exist unless some of us pay back into it. None of this information that we take for granted is being churned out by some machine. It&#8217;s churned out by people! And do you know how hard it is to churn out meaningful, useful information with depth and substance and ethos?</p>

<h1>It&#8217;s fucking hard!</h1>

<p>And because it&#8217;s hard, like exercise, most of us don&#8217;t do it. Well I say, fuck that! We can all be better at what we do, especially if it&#8217;s going to be our life&#8217;s work. For me that means setting aside some time to work a little extra and write about my successes and failures. It means willing myself to push beyond what I normally think I can do and hoping that if I stick with it, eventually pieces will fall into place, doors will unlock, and the heavens will rain cheeseburgers and High West rye whiskey.</p>

<h2>What Did I Learn?</h2>

<p>In the process of writing every day, for 60 days, I learned a ton. My posts were at times very scattershot, Ruby one day, D3.js the next, random Sublime tips after that, etc etc etc. I get frustrated and I need to switch gears. This is something I have to work on.</p>

<p>There was a part of me that didn&#8217;t think I would be able to go all 60 days. I have been a total quitter more times than I&#8217;d like to admit and the older I get the more I realize what a massive disservice that is to one&#8217;s self. Finishing isn&#8217;t the most important thing, it&#8217;s the <em>only</em> thing. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you finish in a fucked up death race mobile covered in sinew and tree branches&#8230; just finish!</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>

<p>So what now?</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;ve got two ideas kicking around. One is to keep following in Chris&#8217; steps and to self publish a book. I was dead set on this until a very fateful evening when I watched <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie.</a> Now I can&#8217;t get the idea of self-publishing a <em>very</em> tiny game out of my mind&#8230; Thankfully I have 3 weeks in Europe to think it over :D - Rob</p>
